# hello-world
Setting up my github!

Hello- 

My name is Bennett Summy, and I'm here to start working on some personal coding projects. 
My goal is to enrich my education with a couple side projects, and get some new experience out of it.
Also, doing work on open source projects with others also seems like an interesting way to build my 
programming skills. 

If you have any ideas for me, or advice on my journey, feel free to reach out! 
-Bennett
